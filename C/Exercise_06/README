1. Create File:
	#include <stdio.h>

	int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
	    int distance = 100;
	    float power = 2.345f;
	    double super_power = 56789.4532;
	    char initial = 'A';
	    char first_name[] = "Zed";
	    char last_name[] = "Shaw";

	    printf("You are %d miles away.\n", distance);
	    printf("You have %f levels of power.\n", power);
	    printf("You have %f awesome super powers.\n", super_power);
	    printf("I have an initial %c.\n", initial);
	    printf("I have a first name %s.\n", first_name);
	    printf("I have a last name %s.\n", last_name);
	    printf("My whole name is %s %c. %s.\n",
	            first_name, initial, last_name);

	    return 0;
	}

2. Understand each type, and how printf deals with them

3. break the code and understand why.

4. Research how many different ways you can write a number. Try octal, hexadecimal, and others you can find.

5. Try printing an empty string that's just "".
